The code provided is a Java solution for searching a target element in a rotated sorted array using binary search. The logic involves identifying the sorted half of the array and then adjusting the search range accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized to 0 (the start of the array).
   - `right` is initialized to `nums.length - 1` (the end of the array).

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop runs as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of `left` and `right`.

3. **Check for Target:**
   - If `nums[mid]` equals the target, `mid` is returned as the index of the target.

4. **Identify Sorted Half:**
   - If `nums[mid] >= nums[left]`, it indicates that the left half of the array is sorted.
     - Check if the target lies within this sorted left half (`nums[left] <= target && target <= nums[mid]`).
     - If yes, move `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
     - Otherwise, move `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - If `nums[mid] < nums[left]`, it indicates that the right half of the array is sorted.
     - Check if the target lies within this sorted right half (`nums[mid] <= target && target <= nums[right]`).
     - If yes, move `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
     - Otherwise, move `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.

5. **Return -1 if Not Found:**
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, `-1` is returned.

Here is the same code with added comments for clarity:

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] >= nums[left]) {  // Left half is sorted
                if (nums[left] <= target && target <= nums[mid]) {  // Target in left half
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {  // Target in right half
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {  // Right half is sorted
                if (nums[mid] <= target && target <= nums[right]) {  // Target in right half
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {  // Target in left half
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;  // Target not found
    }
}
```

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging the properties of the rotated sorted array and has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
